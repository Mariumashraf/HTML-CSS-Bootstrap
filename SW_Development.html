				 we will give you a brief overview of software development,<br>
				 software development process and some tips to build a successful software business,<br>
				 Follow our guide, and you’ll see things won’t be too tough.<br><br><br>
				 <b> 1.Understand software development </b><br>
				 <b> 1.1. What is software? </b><br><br><br>
				First thing first, it’s necessary to find out the answer to "what is software",<br> 
				We, however, won’t give you our definition because there is no answer that could rival the one from Wikipedia:<br> 
				"Computer software, or simply software, is a collection of data or computer instructions that tell the computer how to work."<br><br><br><br>

				<h2> Types of Software</h2><br><br>
				<ul> 
				  <li><b>System software:</b><br>
				  <p>This one performs multiple vital functions on your computer,<br> 
				  for example, operation software (iOS, Android, Windows, etc.), utilities (Anti-virus,<br> 
				  Clipboard managers, Diagnostic programs, etc.) and hardware management.<br> 
				  </p>
				  
				  </li><br>
				  <li> <b>Application software:</b><br>
					<p> These are the one we must be really familiar with. We use it to carry out a certain activity such as listening to a song, watching videos, sharing photos, etc<br>
					    Nowadays, application software, or shortly, apps are taking over the world by storm and generate huge amounts of revenue for app publishers.</p>
				  </li><br>
				   <li><b>Malicious software (or malware):</b> <br>
				   <p> The name has shown it all, the very kind of software is able to harm or damage your devices. Its purposes might be just to prank, or worse, to steal your information, scam, etc. Viruses, Worms, Trojans, Ransomware, Fileless Malware, Malvertising,
				       Spyware, etc. are several common types of malware.</p>
				   </li><br><br><br><br>
				   
				   
				   
				   
				   
				   <h3><b> What is Agile Software development?</b><h3><br>

						<p> methodology has been applied in an inundating number of businesses since 2016.<br> 
						Companies are either pursuing this method’s customer-centric core values.<br> 
						Or claiming they are applying it in order to capture the clientele’s attention,<br> 
                       A genuine software development company would know the method by heart since 
					   the top priority is their customer’s interest.<br> 
					   Which is exactly what the Agile software development method concentrates on.
					   </p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
					   
             			<img class="Agile" src= "images/Software_Development_3.png" width="500px" height="300px"><br>
						
						<p>Agile SDLC takes a developer through six basic stages of a typical project. Including planning, analysis, design, implementation, testing and integration, and maintenance. Instagram and Spotify are among the prominent case studies of businesses.<br>
						And taking risks of shifting their software development method from Waterfall or Scrum to Agile.<br>
						Leading to major success in the area of mobile application (mobile app) development.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br>
		
						
						
						<h3>The roles of people in an Agile team</h3><br>
						
						<center><img src= "images/Software_Development_4.png" width="1000px" height="300px"></center><br><br>
						If the Agile approach was so praised by companies whose software development projects proved the success of the development methodology,<br>
						then how should you as a business owner implement this approach and how can you structure your organization for the new project? In a human-centric manifesto like Agile, there is no heavy sense of hierarchy as elements like human interaction, communication and teamwork are valuable over the order of an organization. 
						<br>Since the approach is big on adaptability and customers’ feedback, the role of testers is of the most important since the product’ success is without customers’ actual need and demand. The diagram below is to show you the basic roles of your human resources in a project that implements Agile.

						<h3>Agile work process </h3>
						<br><br>						
						<p>The work process in Agile software development approach goes through basic steps from research,<br>
						estimation, quality assurance, development, design, prototyping, and launching. Each business aims at <br>
						a different specific feature of the project. If it is heavily based on research and development (R&D). The <br>
						first steps of market research, customer survey and discovery will most likely happen along the work <br>
						process as opposed to the beginning of the project.<br>
						If your business is all about the best quality a product can offer the market, the step of quality <br>
						assurance, quality control, and customer support would be of vitality since top quality is purely decided <br>
						by product users. To each their own, each business needs to determine the top priority of their project <br>
						outcome and discuss it with developers as communication is the key topic of Agile.</p><br>
